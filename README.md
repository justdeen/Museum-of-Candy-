# 🍭 Museum of Candy
I decided to code alongside my udemy instructor to actualize this mini frontend project. I had to incorporate bootstrap to enable me structure the contents with ease and to allow for responsiveness across multiple screen sizes. Using bootstrap didn't come without its problems as I encountered certain constraints which I managed to overcome by simply employing css specificity. Coding this type of interface from scratch is very much doable but a front-end framework like bootstrap makes the process faster. 


### 📦 Dependencies;
1. Bootstrap 5.3.3
2. jQuery 3.7.1
3. Popper.js 2.11.8
